# rust-guide
A guide to rust for the rusty, or even simply a beginner.

This repo is meant to house snippets, gotchas, debugging techniques, walkthroughs, anything Rust related
that could help a fellow Rust dev, young and old.

## Installation
Everyone has to start somewhere, right?

I would look at the [Rust Homepage][rust-homepage] if you have not already. I use Mac, so if you are running on another
OS, feel free to contribute some solid installation instructions, or simply install via the homepage.

### MacOSX
[Homebrew][homebrew-homepage] is awesome. Use that. `brew install rust`
If not, the [Rust Homepage][rust-homepage] has installation instructions for all supported OSs.

## IDE Support
IntelliJ by Jetbrains has a [supported Rust plugin][intellij-rust] that is no doubtedly good to use
if you use those IDEs.

Emacs has great support for a Rust environment as well. `rust-mode` and `cargo` are baseline packages,
and there are [plenty of blogs][emacs-rust-blog] if you want some more guidance.
